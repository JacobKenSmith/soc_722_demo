##Question 1
```{r}
library(tidyverse)




df <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NicolasRestrep/223_course/main/Data/nfl_salaries.csv")
```
I just imported the data here, it was light work.

##Question 2
```{r}
df_tidy <- df %>% 
  pivot_longer(names_to = "position", 
               values_to = "salary", 
               cols = -year)
```

As the data itself was pretty ugly, i tided it up with pivot_longer and put all data within 3 columns

#Question 3
```{r}
quarterbacks <- df_tidy %>% 
  filter(position %in% "Quarterback")

ggplot(data = quarterbacks, mapping = aes(x = salary)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 35) +
  facet_wrap(~ year)

```
The most evident pattern was the fact that the large majority of salaries were in the lower end, while there were a fewer on the higher end.

##Question 4

```{r}
df_tidy <- drop_na(df_tidy)
average_pay <- df_tidy |> 
  group_by(position, year) |> 
    summarize(mean = mean(salary))
```

To provide clarity, I then grouped the tidy dataframe by position and year. Those were then averaged to provide a picture into the pay of football players.


#Question 5     
```{r}
ggplot(average_pay, aes(x = year, y = mean, col = position)) +
  geom_line(position = "dodge") +
  labs (x = "Year", y = "Average Salary")
```

These were the mapped to provide a clearer image across different positions
