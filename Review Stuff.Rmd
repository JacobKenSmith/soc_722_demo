I feel comfortable with most of the theoretical justifcations for the stuff we're doing but lose the thread on some of the metrics/graphing aspects.
So I generally feel as i'm lacking on a few fronts.

1st - I'm generally uncomfortable in graphing some of the outputs that we get. I can do the basic stuff but some of the advanced comparisons/metrics elludes me.

2nd - I would love a thorough run through of each of the metrics that we've covered in class to evaluate a regression. I'm comfortable on some, but not necessarily comfortable on others. 

3rd - I would appreciate some more indepth discussion on the intricacies of rstanarm, as it seems to be way more helpful.
